## Solve

We open the network capture file with Wireshark and see it's a TCP stream of HTTP requests.

There are only a couple actual requests, which are downloading some images from a local webserver.    
Opening the last HTTP response packet, Wireshark lets us export only those bytes of the packet that contain the image:

Which gives us the flag:

`404CTF{345Y_W1r35h4rK}`

## Comments

The write-ups I linked above have an even simpler way of getting all the images out of the capture. I didn't know!
